## Overview

This project is a **Motion Detection System** built using Python and computer vision techniques. The main goal is to detect and respond to movement captured by a webcam or video feed in real time.

It‚Äôs a great introduction to motion tracking and surveillance systems using basic **machine learning** and **OpenCV** functionalities.

## Features

- üîç Real-time motion detection
- üì∑ Webcam/video feed input support
- üìè Frame differencing and contour detection
- üí° Lightweight and easy to customize

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Numpy

## How It Works

The system compares video frames over time to detect changes. When movement is detected (based on pixel differences), it highlights the moving objects and can optionally log the event or trigger alerts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Motion-Detection-System.git
   cd Motion-Detection-System
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

3. Run the motion detection script:
   ```bash
   python motion_detection.py
   ```

## Example Output

When motion is detected, the system highlights the area of movement with rectangles and can optionally display timestamps or log activity.

```plaintext
[Motion Detected] at 2025-04-22 15:47:08
```

## Future Improvements

- Add alarm or notification system on motion detection
- Integrate with security camera feeds
- Build GUI for live monitoring
- Capture and save motion-triggered frames or videos
- Add person recognition using deep learning
